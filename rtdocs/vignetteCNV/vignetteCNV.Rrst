Vignette Using CNV Data
=======================

.. {r-setup}
..opts_chunk$set(out.width=5, out.height=5)

.. {r load-data}
#### make sure to load gUtils
..library(gTrack)
#### load in SCNA data
#### these are level 3 segments from over 1600 TCGA breast cancer cases
#### downloaded from the TCGA and converted to a single GRanges object 
..scna = seg2gr(readRDS(system.file(c('extdata/files'), 'scna.rds', package = 'gTrack')))

#### we define amplification events and deletion events
#### and then do a simple recurrence analysis on amplifications

#### amplification events are defined using %Q% gUtils operator to filter
#### on scna metadata for segments with seg.mean greater than 1
#### greater than 50 markers and width less than 1MB
.. amps = scna %Q% (seg.mean<(-1) & num.mark > 50 & width < 1e7)

#### apply a similar filter to define deletions
.. dels = scna %Q% (seg.mean<(-1) & num.mark > 50 & width < 1e7)

#### compute the amplification "score" as the total number of amplification
#### events in a given region
.. amp.score = as(coverage(amps), 'GRanges')

#### define the peaks of amplification as the 100 regions with
#### the highest amplification score
.. amp.peaks = amp.score %Q% (rev(order(score))) %Q% (1:100)

#### "reduce" or merge the top peaks to find areas of recurrent amplification
..amp.peaks = reduce(amp.peaks+1e5) %$% amp.peaks %Q% (rev(order(score)))

### do a similar analysis for dels
..del.score = as(coverage(dels), 'GRanges')
..del.peaks = del.score %Q% (rev(order(score))) %Q% (1:100)
..del.peaks = reduce(del.peaks+1e5) %$% del.peaks %Q% (rev(order(score)))

#### load in GRanges of GENCODE genes
..genes = readRDS(system.file("extdata", 'genes.rds', package = "gTrack"))

#### use %$% operator to annotate merged amp and del peaks with "gene name" metadata
..amp.peaks = amp.peaks %$% genes[, 'gene_name']
..del.peaks = del.peaks %$% genes[, 'gene_name']

### now that we've computed scores and annotated peaks
### we want to inspect these peaks and plot them with gTrack

### load in precomputed gTrack of hg19 GENCODE annotation
### (note this is different from the GENCODE genes which is a GRanges
### we loaded in a previous line .. this is purely for visualization)
..ge = track.gencode()


#### build a gTrack of amps colored in red with black border
#### and one of dels colored in blue 
..gt.amps = gTrack(amps,  col = 'red', name = 'Amps')
..gt.dels = gTrack(dels, col = 'blue', name = 'Dels')

#### build a gTrack of amp and del score as a line plot
..gt.amp.score = gTrack(amp.score, y.field = 'score',
    col = 'red', name = 'Amp score', line = TRUE)
..gt.del.score = gTrack(del.score, y.field = 'score',
    col = 'blue', name = 'Amp score', line = TRUE)

#### build a gTrack of peaks of amp and del peaks
..gt.amp.peaks = gTrack(amp.peaks, gr.labelfield = 'gene_name', 
    col = 'pink', border = 'black', name = 'Amp peaks', height = 5)
..gt.del.peaks = gTrack(del.peaks, gr.labelfield = 'gene_name',
    col = 'lightblue', border = 'black', name = 'Amp peaks', height = 5)

### let's look at the top amplification peak
..amp.peaks[1]

### interesting! this looks like a novel peak with genes that have
### not previously been associated with breast cancer
### ("RP11-122L4.1, AC123767.1, CTD-2024D23.1, ADAM18, ADAM2")

### let's look at the data supporting this peak - including
### the underlying amp events, amp score, and peak region boundary

.. ..

.. {r-plot1}
..plot(c(ge, gt.amps, gt.amp.peaks, gt.amp.score), amp.peaks[1]+1e6)
.. ..

.. {r-2nd-general}
### hmm, something looks suspicious since all the segments have the same
### start and end.  These could be copy number artifacts that often arise
### in segmentation of array data, sometimes due to germline copy number
### polymorphisms. 


### to see this pattern more clearly, let's enlarge the
### amplification track, also add the deletion data, and replot
..my.gt = c(ge, gt.dels, gt.del.peaks, gt.del.score,
            gt.amps, gt.amp.peaks, gt.amp.score)
.. ..

.. {r-plot2}
..plot(my.gt, amp.peaks[1]+1e6)
.. ..

.. {r-3rd-general}
### interesting so this appears to also be a peak in the deletion analysis
### and a region that accumulates both amplification and deletion calls in
### many tumor samples.  This could either be a copy number polymorphism
### or an artifact.

### let's load in a track of copy events from the Database of Germline Variation
### which catalogues common copy changes in human populations
..dgv = readRDS(system.file(c('extdata/files'), 'dgv.rds', package = 'gTrack'))
.. .. 

.. {r-plot3}
..plot(c(ge, gt.amps, gt.amp.peaks, gt.amp.score), amp.peaks[1]+1e6)
.. .. 

.. {r-4th-general}

### indeed looks like this is a region around which people have previously
### seen germline copy number variations, so it's likely an artifact

### let's look at the next amp peak
..print(amp.peaks[2])

### this peak includes  CCND1 in addition to other genes
### this peak is known to be a target of amplification in breast cancer
### and so likely real

### let's plot it:

.. {r-5th-general}

### unlike the previous peak this has an enrichment of amplifications vs deletions
### not known have a bunch of germline copy number changes in the DGV

### let's zoom in on the individual events, getting rid of the other tracks
### increase the height of the amp track
### and adding a black border to better define event boundaries
..gt.amps$border = 'black'
..gt.amps$height = 30
..my.gt = c(ge, gt.amps, gt.amp.peaks, gt.amp.score)
.. ..

.. {r-plot5}
..plot(my.gt, amp.peaks[2]+1e6)
.. ..

.. {r-6th-general}

### here each red segment is a somatic amplification or gain in a different patietn
### the peak looks real, in that the events have relatively random starts
### and ends and cluster around this target gene.
