How to Graph Structural Variations
=====================================


.. {r load coverage file}
## this load sequences that have had coverage calculated from cancer cell lines (GRanges object, have to make into a gTrack)
..cov = readRDS('inst/extdata/coverage.rds')

## wrap a gTrack around this, draw with blue circles, and label the track "Cov" and sets 0 as lower bound for all views 
..gt.cov = gTrack(cov, y.field = 'mean', circles = TRUE, col = 'blue', name = 'Cov')

## this loads the junctions data from the cell line (GRangesList, where each item is a length 2 GRanges
## with strand information specifying the two locations and strands that are being fused) 
junctions = readRDS('inst/extdata/junctions.rds')

## loading the GENCODE gene model gTrack (hg19 pre-loaded comes with gTrack,
## but can be made from any .gff file from GENCODE (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html)
gt.ge = track.gencode()

## this loads a gTrack object of a genome graph i.e. network of the same cancer cell line (generated by JaBba)
graph = readRDS('inst/extdata/graph.rds')

## pick an interesting junction and plot the genes, coverage, and genome graph around it
## the links argument specifies the junctions that are being drawn
window = junctions[[290]] + 1e5

plot(c(gt.ge, gt.cov, graph), window, links = junctions)
