How to Graph Structural Variations

    ## this load sequences that have had coverage calculated from cancer cell lines (GRanges object, have to make into a gTrack)
    cov = readRDS('~/Documents/gTrack/inst/extdata/coverage.rds')
    
    ## wrap a gTrack around this, draw with blue circles, and label the track "Cov" and sets 0 as lower bound for all views 
    gt.cov = gTrack(cov, y.field = 'mean', circles = TRUE, col = 'blue', name = 'Cov')
    
    ## this loads the junctions data from the cell line (GRangesList, where each item is a length 2 GRanges
    ## with strand information specifying the two locations and strands that are being fused) 
    junctions = readRDS('~/Documents/gTrack/inst/extdata/junctions.rds')
    
    ## loading the GENCODE gene model gTrack (hg19 pre-loaded comes with gTrack,
    ## but can be made from any .gff file from GENCODE (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html)
    gt.ge = track.gencode()
